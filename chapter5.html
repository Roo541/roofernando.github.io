									<h3>Chapter 5: Theoretical Evaluation </h3>

						<p>
							<strong>Summary</strong> <br>
							Talk about what this chapter was? <br>
							What were the main takeaways?<br>
							Any good analogies gained from it?<br>
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Exercise problems:</strong> <br>
						In an arbitrage-free market, where no arbitrage profit is available, the expected value for a contract
						at maturity (its average value at maturity) must be equal to its forward price. <br>
						
							1. The following diagram represents the price distribution and associated probabilities for an underlying contract
							three months from now. <br>
							<a class="image"><img src="images/Textbook_Work_Throughs/exercises/5.1.1.jpg" width="600" height="auto" /></a><br>
							a. If there is no arbitrage opportunity, what should be the three-month forward price for the underlying contract? <br>
							b. What are the expected values for the following options? <br>
							<a class="image"><img src="images/Textbook_Work_Throughs/exercises/5.1.2.jpg" width="600" height="auto" /></a><br>
							c. Can you identify a relationship between the expected value of a call and put with the same exercise price? <br>
							d. The theoretical value of an option is the present value of its expected value at expiration.
							If all options are European and subject to stock-type settlement, there are three months to expiration, 
							and annual interest rates are 6.00%, to the nearest .01 what is the theoretical value of each option? <br>
							e. Suppose the underlying contract is a stock that is expected to pay a dividend of .75 over the next three months.
							Ignoring interest on dividends, to the nearest .01 what should be the current price of the stock? <br>

							2. The following diagram represents the probability and price distribution for an underlying stock six months 
							from now. <br>
							<a class="image"><img src="images/Textbook_Work_Throughs/exercises/5.2.1.jpg" width="600" height="auto" /></a><br>
							a. If the stock is currently trading at a price of 72.50, annual interest rates are 8%, and the stock pays no 
							dividends, to the nearest .01 what is the stock's six-month forward price, F? <br>
							b. Suppose we assign a value of 5.00 to each interval, I. What are the stock prices, F-2I through F+2I, on the 
							above probability distribution? <br>
							c. Using these price intervals, what is the expected value for the underlying stock? <br>
							d. Given the forward price and expected value for the underlying stock, what strategy might you pursue? <br>
							e. If all options are European and subject to stock-type settlement, there are six months to expiration,
							and annual interest rates are 8.00%, to the nearest .01 what is the expected value and theoretical value
							of each option? <br>
							<a class="image"><img src="images/Textbook_Work_Throughs/exercises/5.2.2.jpg" width="600" height="auto" /></a><br>
							<a class="image"><img src="images/Textbook_Work_Throughs/exercises/5.2.3.jpg" width="600" height="auto" /></a><br>
							<a class="image"><img src="images/Textbook_Work_Throughs/exercises/5.2.4.jpg" width="600" height="auto" /></a><br>

							3. In question 1c the following relationship seemed to be true:<br>
							call expected value - put expected value = forward price - exercise price <br>
							a. Using the values in question 2, does the relationship still hold true? If not, is there an alternative 
							relationship? <br>
							b. What annual interest rate will result in the six-month forward price for the stock being equal to 
							the stock's expected value? <br>
							c. Suppose we increase the value of I in question 2 to 10.00. What are the new underlying prices, F-2I through F+2I,
							on the above probability distribution? <br>
							d. What is the expected value for the underlying contract? <br> 
							e. If all options are European and subject to stock-type settlement, there are six months to expiration, and annual 
							interest rates are 8.00%, to the nearest .01 what is the expected value and theoretical value of each option? <br>
							f. Now what is the relationship between the expected value of a call and put at the same exercise price? <br>
