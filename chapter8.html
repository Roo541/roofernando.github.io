						<strong>1. </strong> The process of delta hedging an option position to remain delta neutral is an important part using a 
						theoretical pricing model. In a delta neutral position all the deltas add up to approximately zero, or at least as close to 
						zero as is practically possible. <br>
						\[
						\begin{array}{|l|l||l|l|}
						\hline
						  \text{} & \text{July 70} & \text{July 80}& \text{July 90}\\ 
						\hline
						\text{call delta} & \text{70} & \text{41} & \text{18} \\
						\hline
						\hline
						\text{put delta} & \text{-30} & \text{-59} & \text{-82} \\
						\hline
						\end{array}
						\]
						<strong>a. </strong> You buy 25 July 80 calls. From the table of delta values above, what do you need to do (buy? sell? how many?)
						to hedge your position as close to delta neutral as possible using each of the following contracts?
						\[
						\begin{array}{|l|l|l|l|}
						\hline
						\textbf{i. } & \text{underlying contract} & \text{ 10.25} & \text{-10}\\
						\hline
						\hline
						\textbf{ii.} & \text{July 90 call} & \text{56.94} & \text{-57}\\
						\hline
						\hline
						\textbf{iii. } & \text{July 80 put} & \text{17.37} & \text{+17}\\
						\hline
						\end{array}
						\]
						
						Answer:<br>
						$$ \text{Delta position on the initial +25 contracts of the July 80 Calls is +1025}   $$
						$$ \textbf{i. } \frac{1025}{100} = 10.25 \text{ ,1 underlying contract represents 100 delta} $$
						$$ \text{Since our original position is +1025 delta we need to sell roughly 10 contracts to remain Delta neutral} $$
						$$ \textbf{ii. } \frac{1025}{18} = 56.94, \text{Sell roughly 57 July 90 Call contracts to remain delta neutral of original position}   $$
						$$ \textbf{iii. } \frac{1025}{59} = 17.37, \text{Buy roughly 17 July 80 Puts to remain delta neutral}  $$

						<strong>b. </strong> You sell 50 July 70 puts. What do you need to do (buy? sell? how many?) to hedge your position a close to delta 
						neutral as possible using each of the following contracts.
						\[
						\begin{array}{|l|l|l|l|}
						\hline
						\textbf{i. } & \text{July 70 call} & \text{ 21.42} & \text{-21}\\
						\hline
						\hline
						\textbf{ii.} & \text{July 80 put} & \text{25.42} & \text{+25}\\
						\hline
						\hline
						\textbf{iii. } & \text{July 90 put} & \text{18.30} & \text{+18}\\
						\hline
						\end{array}
						\]
						
						Answer: <br>
						$$ \text{Same as previous part as we are trying to calculate an opposing delta to our original}  $$ 
						$$ \text{delta position of +1500 from selling 50 July 70 puts}  $$

						<strong>c. </strong> You sell 15 underlying contracts. You would like to hedge half your delta position using July 80 puts and the other 
						half using July 90 calls. As close as possible, how many of each contract do you need to buy or to sell?<br>
						Answer:<br>
						$$ \text{We have an initial delta of -1500 from selling 15 underlying contracts}   $$
						$$ \text{Objective is to hedge our -1500 delta with half the deltas coming from the July 80 puts and half using July 90 calls}  $$
						$$ \text{July 80 puts, } \frac{750}{59} = 12.7 \text{ meaning selling roughly 13 giving us delta of +767}   $$
						$$ \text{July 90 calls, } \frac{750}{18} = 41.6 \text{ meaning buying roughly 41 giving us delta of +738}   $$
						$$ \text{Summing these two positions we get a net delta of +5 which is near delta neutral}   $$<br>

						<strong>2. </strong> In each of the option positions below, how many underlying contracts do you need to buy or sell in order to 
						create an initial delta neutral position? Then, as the delta changes, how many underlying contracts do you need to buy or sell
						in order to maintain a delta neutral position, or a position that is as close to delta neutral as possible? Delta values are
						given in the whole number format.<br>
						<strong>a. </strong> long 10 calls <br>
						\[
						\begin{array}{|l|l|l|}
						\hline
						\text{Current Option Delta} & \text{Current Total Delta Position} & \text{Underlying Contracts to Buy or Sell}\\
						\hline
						\hline
						\text{70} & \text{+700} & \text{-7}\\
						\hline
						\hline
						\text{50} & \text{-200} & \text{+2}\\
						\hline
						\hline
						\text{40} & \text{-100} & \text{+1}\\
						\hline
						\hline
						\text{80} & \text{+400} & \text{-4}\\
						\hline
						\end{array}
						\]
						Explanation:<br>
						Initially we calculate the first row. We are long 10 70 calls giving us a delta of +700. We need to sell 7 underlying contracts 
						(-700 delta) to remain delta neutral. Then in the second row we see our option delta decreases to 50. Since we are still short 7 
						underlying contracts we have a current delta position of -200. To remain delta neutral we need to buy 2 underlying contracts (+200).
						The next row we see that the delta decreases once again to 40. We are short 5 underlying contracts giving us a total delta of -100. 
						To get back to delta neutral we need to buy 1 underlying contract. On the final row we see that the option delta goes to 80. We 
						are now +400 delta meaning we have to sell 4 underlying contracts to get back to delta neutral. Overall idea is to go from 
						row to row keeping track of the total position delta. When the total delta is unbalances adjustments in terms of buying or selling 
						underlying contracts are done to get back to being delta neutral. <br><br>
